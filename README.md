## Inspiration
The demand for education is increasing with each passing year, forcing colleges to admit more and more students. This has led
to larger class sizes where, unfortunately, professors have no choice but to mass-lecture to hundreds of students. 
In the face of this generic learning experience, our vision is to make personalized education feasible.

In our experience, office hours provide an invaluable, personalized opportunity at getting help. Students are able to directly
speak with instructors/assistants, get instant feedback, and truly digest the material.

However, office hours are limited. Restricted to small rooms or a few tables and only available for a few hours
scattered throughout the week, it's far too easy for students to not get the help they need. And, with the rise in admissions, 
it's becoming obvious that office hours don't scale. Our solution: Virtus.

## What it does
Virtus is a platform for hosting online office hours. Instructors can register their class, set up a 
broadcast, and host their office hours remotely. Students can then join the stream, submit questions to the instructor, and 
collaborate with other students in a chatroom, gaining a personalized education without the limitations of a physical
room.

Virtus also removes the temporal bounds of traditional office hours: all broadcasts are automatically saved as recordings after 
they've ended, allowing students who cannot make the session to learn at a time convenient for them. This also saves 
instructors from having to manage hoards of students, many of whom come to learn from other students' questions.
